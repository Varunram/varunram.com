        MyEtherWallet is the first open source web3.0 blockchain interface developed
        to enable people to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in a user friendly way. Starting
        as a single html page developed at the time of the DAO fork, it eventually expanded to other
        coins and tokens on Ethereum and is the most widely used wallet amongst the Ethereum community.
      </p>
      <p>
        MyEtherWallet uses vanilla Javascript with modifications on the backend and React.js
        on the frontend. It also has a Google Chrome plugin to enable quick access and a Desktop Application
        is udner work, which would enable people to interface with the blockchain in a more secure manner.

        My contributions were related to bug fixing, UI fixes and general code cleanups.
        Unknown / redundant code poses a huge threat to software and interfaces like MyEtherWallet handling
        billions of dollars of money are specially vulnerable. I also integrated Musicoin support into MyEtherWallet
        after Musicoin was started and reported other issues that I couldn't fix myself.
