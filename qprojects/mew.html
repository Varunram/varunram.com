        MyEtherWallet was the first open source blockchain interface developed
        to enable people to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in a user friendly way. Starting
        as a single html page used by a few people, it eventually expanded to other
        coins and is easily the most used wallet in the Ethereum community.
      </p>
      <p>
        MyEtherWallet uses vanilla Javascript with modifications on the backend and React.js
        on the frontend. It also has a Google Chrome plugin to enable quick access.
      </p>
      <p>
        My contributions were related to bug fixing, javascript fixes and code cleanups.
        Unknown / Redundant code poses a huge threat to interfaces like MyEtherWallet handling
        billions of dollars of money. I also integrated Musicoin support with MyEtherWallet
        after Musicoin was started and reported other issues that I couldn't fix myself.
