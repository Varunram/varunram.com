        MyEtherWallet was the first open source blockchain interface written
        to enable people to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily. It started
        out as a single html page used by a few people to something far more
        used than the official Mist Wallet of Ethereum. It eventually expanded to other
        coins and is one of the best interfaces out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        MyEtherWallet is written in Javascript on the backend and frontend. It uses React.js
        on the frontend and also has a google chrome plugin to enable quick access.
      </p>
      <p>
        My contributions were related to bug fixing, javascript fixes and code cleanups.
        Unknown / Redundant code poses a huge thread to an interface like MyEtherWallet handling
        potentially billions of dollars of people's money. I also happened
        to add Musicoin support into MyEtherWallet (after Musicoin was started) and reported
        other issues that I could not personally fix.
