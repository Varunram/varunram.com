      <p>
      Metabase is a database visualization framework that can be used with a host of databases.
      There are tons of database frameworks and it is difficult for people to remember all of them.
      This is where metabase steps in, providing easy access queries with UI buttons. Metabase also
      provides data analysis tools that can be used to analysze the database.
      </p>

        I was helping a startup founded by one of my acquaintances and he
        wanted a db visualization framework, hence my acquaintance with metabase. During the time
        I worked on metabase, I found tons of issues and reported them to the metabase
        team. I also put in a few frontend fixes and learnt about Clojure,
        which metabase uses on the backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I loved testing metabase as I felt it was a cool idea to have both
        visualization and analytics under the same roof. This eliminates the
        need for 100s of spreadsheets and formulae as well, clearing up clutter.
