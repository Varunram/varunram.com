      <p>
      Metabase is a database visualization framework that can be used with a host of databases.
      There are tons of database types out there and its difficult for someone to remember all
      queries and this is where metabase steps in, providing easy access queries. Metabase also
      provides a data analyiss framework that can be used to analysze the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was hepling a startup founded by one of my acquaintances at the time and they
        wanted a db visualization framework, so I helped them out with metabase. During my
        time of working with metabase, I found tons of issues and reported them to the metabase
        team. I also put in a few frontend fixes and learnt about a new language called Clojure,
        which metabase happened to be using.
      </p>
      <p>
        I loved testing out metabase as I thought it was a cool idea to have both
        db visualization and db analytics within the same framework. This also eliminates the
        need for excel professionals who frequentyl have 100s of spreadsheets
