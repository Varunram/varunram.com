      <p>
        American Fuzzy Lop or AFL was developed at google by lcamtuf and later
        open sourced. It is a dumb, mutation based fuzzer which randomly mutates inputs
        to the source program. AFL needs to be compiled along with the program
        executable (eg. the gcc compiler) for one to proceed with fuzzing the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fuzz the program, one must pass the target executable to aflfuzz and
        wait for it to discover paths. There's a command line UI attached to aflfuzz which shows the current state
        of fuzzing. Complete fuzzing may take several hours if not days on standard
        consumer hardware and this is a main motivation behind having the CLI UI<UI></UI>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project I worked on at École Normale Supérieure, Paris
        was regarding the applicability of fuzzers to LaTeX and to see if the LaTeX
        executable was vulnerable to rogue pdfs and inputs.
        During the course of two months, we started off from the basics of fuzzers,
        moved on to implement one test case after the other feeding inputs to afl,
        compiled ouputs and then finally documented our findings. We also experimented
        with other fuzzers to compare their performance to afl and see where we
        could improve afl.
