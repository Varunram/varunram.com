      <p>
        American Fuyzzy Lop or AFL was developed initially by lcamtuf at google and later
        open sourced. AFL is a dumb mutation based fuzzer which randomly mutates inputs
        to the source program given. It needs to be compiled into the source of the program
        executable (for example the gcc compiler) and then one can proceed normally with
        compiling and running the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fuzz the program, one must run the target executable from within afl and then
        wait for it to find unknown paths. There's a UI which shows the current state
        of fuzzing and complete fuzzing may take several hours if not days on standard
        consumer hardware
      </p>

        The project I worked on at École Normale Supérieure, Paris with Dr. David Naccache was regarding the
        applicability of fuzzers to LaTeX and to see if the LaTeX executable was
        vulnerable to rogue pdfs and inputs.
        During the course of two months, we started off from the basics of fuzzers and
        then moved to implement one test case after the other, feeding inputs to afl,
        getting ouputs and then documenting them when required. We also experimented
        with other fuzzers to compare their performance to afl and see where we
        could improve afl's fuzzing techniques. We also analysed the way in which
        afl mutates its inputs and suggested a few changes towards the end.

        It was a very in tersting project since I, just coming back from workin on Nmap
        was more oriented towards the network side of things and then I started to work on
        fuzzing which w as an entirely new thing to me at the time. I learnt tons of new things
        during my time at ENS and met lots of interesting people, from whom I got loads of
        interesting ideas.
