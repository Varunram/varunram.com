      <p>
        American Fuzzy Lop or AFL was developed at google by lcamtuf and later
        open sourced. It is a dumb, mutation based fuzzer which randomly mutates inputs
        into the source program. It needs to be compiled along with the program
        executable (eg the gcc compiler) and then one can proceed with fuzzing the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fuzz the program, one must run the target executable from within afl using aflfuzz and then
        wait for it to discover paths. There's a UI attached which shows the current state
        of fuzzing since complete fuzzing may take several hours if not days on standard
        consumer hardware.

        The project I worked on at École Normale Supérieure, Paris
        was regarding the applicability of fuzzers to LaTeX and to see if the LaTeX
        executable was vulnerable to rogue pdfs and inputs.
        During the course of two months, we started off from the basics of fuzzers,
        moved on to implement one test case after the other feeding inputs to afl,
        compiled ouputs and then finally documented our findings. We also experimented
        with other fuzzers to compare their performance to afl and see how we
        could improve afl.It was a very interesting project since I, coming back from working on Nmap
        was more oriented towards the network stack and then I happened to work on
