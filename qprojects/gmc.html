      <p>
        The Musicoin project is somewhat close to my heart since I have been there
        since the very founding of the coin. The main idea of the coin when we started it
        was simple - remove the middlemen in the Muisc industry that usurp honest musicians'
        rewards the same way bitcoin removed financial intermediaries. It started out
        pretty simple with 2 people working on the project. Now our team is over 15 members and
        continues to grow strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Musicoin was forked off from Ethereum in order to avoid doing the same kind of thigns that
        Ethereum protocol developers had already done. We chose go-musicoin since that was the most
        popular Ethereum client implementation out there and had lots of dev support.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the initial stages, I did not actively work on go-musicoin since there weren't many protocol
        changes that had to be implemented. But I gradually stepped in more since some team members
        left the project and it was up to me to implement the protocol changes to take the project forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        My contributions to go-musicoin are mostly testing for consensus failures, making sure everything
        runs fine and general bug fixes. I also implement any new Musicoin Improvement Proposals
        that are proposed by the members of the community.
