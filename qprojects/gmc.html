      <p>
        The Musicoin project is close to my heart since I've been a part
        since the start of the project, first in the community and then, as a programmer.
        The main idea behind Musicoin is quite simple in that it seeks to
        remove middlemen from the Music industry that usurp honest musicians'
        rewards. This gives musicians greater control over the content they produce and
        gives them the flexibility to cash out as and when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go-Musicoin was forked off from go-ethereum, a popular Ethereum client
        in order to avoid doing stuff that Ethereum developers had already done and
        were similar to what we were proposing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I did not actively work on go-musicoin since the protocol
        changes that were to be implemented were little and there were other community members to maintain it.
        I gradually stepped in as more protocol changes were required on top of go-musicoin, which had
        to receive close introspection by the Musicoin Team.
      </p>
      <p>
        My contributions and maintenance work in go-musicoin are testing for consensus failures, making sure the code
        runs as expected and general bug fixes. I also review and implement any new Musicoin Improvement Proposals (MCIPs)
        that are proposed by the members of the community for the betterment of the base Musicoin protocol.
