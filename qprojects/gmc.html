      <p>
        The Musicoin project is close to my heart since I've been a part
        since the founding of the coin. The main idea behind Musicoin is simple -
        remove middlemen from the Music industry that usurp honest musicians'
        rewards the same way bitcoin removes financial intermediaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Musicoin was forked off from Ethereum in order to avoid doing the same things that
        Ethereum protocol developers had already done. We chose go-musicoin since it was the most
        popular Ethereum client implementation at the time with lots of developer activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I did not actively work on go-musicoin since there weren't many protocol
        changes that were to be implemented. I gradually stepped in as more protocol changes were required
        on top of go-musicoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        My contributions are mostly testing for consensus failures, making sure everything
        runs fine and general bug fixes. I also implement any new Musicoin Improvement Proposals
        that are proposed by the members of the community.
