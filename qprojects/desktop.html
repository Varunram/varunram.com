        Part of my work at Musicoin is heading something called "The Musicoin Bounty Program"
        which exists to incubate new innovative ideas that may come up within the community and
        to fund any research and development projects within the team and in the community.
        One such initiative is the Musicoin Desktop Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Musicoin Desktop Wallet is written in node-webkit and u ses web3.js as its
        backend framework. Its primary goal is to be as user friendly as possible and to enable
        easy transfer of funds to and from other wallets.
      </p>
      <p>
        I co-maintain the Musicoin Wallet, implementing new features, signing new releases, opening
        new issues, suggesting improvements and reporting new bugs. I also assign bounties to
        tasks to invite people to contribute to open source development and be introduced to the way
        things work at Musicoin. It also serves as a point of entry to someone who wants to work
        full time on the team. The Musicoin community is amazing and I love every minute of being a
        part of the amazing movement.
