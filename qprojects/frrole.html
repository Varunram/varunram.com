      <p>
        Frrole.AI is a company which does Profile Assessment for Recruiters and HR
        Managers. The product I worked on called DeepSense accumulates data
        from different sources and provides personality insights based on four
        categories - Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness.
        A DISC score is also provided, making it easy for recruiters.
      </p>

        I worked on systems at Frrole, setting up backend servers to deal with their
        data pipeline and worked on implementing image based analysis
        using data from Instagram. I also incorporated a third party service called
        ClearBit as a replacement for an existing data provider that was in Frrole's data pipeline.

        Frrole was a different experience for me since I learnt how to wokr in a fast moving startup
        type of culture. I chose to work at Frrole because
        I found their idea interesting and wanted to do improce their product.
        This also gave me the chance to learn more about machine learning models in production systems, which
        is something I've always wanted to do.
