        Frrole.AI is a company which does Profile Assessment for Recruiters and HR
        Managers. The product I worked on called DeepSense, was one which accumulated data
        from different sources and provides personality insights based on four
        categories - Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness.
        A DISC score is also provided, making it easy for recruiters to know which which
        attributes a target user possesses more.

        I worked on systems at Frrole, setting up their backend servers to deal with the
        data pipeline that already existed and also worked on implementing image based analysis
        using data from Instagram to Frrole's Data Pipeline. Along with this, I incorporated
        a third party service called ClearBit as a replacement for an existing data provider.

        Frrole was an entirely new experience for me since I learnt new stuff that were not
        even closely related to my domain of networks. I chose to work with Frrole because
        I found their idea interesting and wanted to do imeplement something productive towards
        the end. This also gave me the chance to learn more about machine learning models, which
        is something I've always wanted to do.
