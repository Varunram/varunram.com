      <p>
        Npcap is a packet capture framework part of the nmap suite. Its function
        is similar to tshark in that it is used to capture network traffic which can
        be analysed with the help of a Wireshark like UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Npcap was in its nascent stages when I started working on it, so it was buggy and had
        lots of cool issues to tackle and fix. I reported bugs, filed issues and helped the lead
        maintainer fix and issue patches for them. I also helped
        reproduce some issues so that we could log waht was happening and tackle them later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Npcap was fun in other ways as well. I could analyse traffic that was stemming from
        the Open WiFi router back at school and find interesting statistics. Most of all,
        Npcap worked perfectly with nmap, so I could do tests on remote servers from Shodan
        to find and report vulnerabilities.
