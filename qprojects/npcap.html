      <p>
        Npcap is a packet capture framework that is part of the nmap suite. Its primary function
        is similar to that of tshark in that its used to capture network traffic which can then
        be analysed with the help of an UI like Wireshark.
      </p>

        Npcap was in its nascent stages when I started working on it, so it was buggy and had
        lots of problems. Being an Open Source project, I reported bugs and helped the lead
        maintainer fix commonly known issues and issue patches for them. I also helped
        reproduce known bugs so we could log them in the appropriate forum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Npcap was also fun in that I could analyse traffic that was stemming from my Open WiFi router
        back at school and I could find out interesting statistics such as the most visited
        sites and most clicked on advertisements. Most of all, Npcap worked perfectly with nmap,
        so I could do some interesting tests on remote servers which one can get from Shodan.
