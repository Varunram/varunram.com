          <h1>Awesome-Regex</h1>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Initially started off as my personal compilation list,
        awesome regex resources are a compilation of the best regex resources available
        on the internet. They are classified based on their application and contains tons of
        cool resources for all levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story behind awesome regex is quite interesting - I developed my own list
        named similarly and only after publishing did I come across the main list.
        We decided to merge both lists and make a single more awesome list, which continues
        to be maintained today
      </p>
      <p>
        Awesome regex is mostly focused on providing people a list of resources that they
        can choose from instead of writing a traditional guide. This gives learners more
        flexibility, something that I found to be lacking in the regex world which was
        more focused on guides and tutorials
