      <p>
        Initially starting off as a personal list,
        awesome regex resources is a compilation of the best regex resources available
        on the internet. Resources are classified on the basis of their application
        and the collection contains tons of such resources for all difficulty levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story behind awesome regex is quite interesting - I developed my own list
        named similarly and only after publishing did I come across another one.
        In the end, the maintainer and I decided to merge both lists and make a single
        more awesome list, which continues to be maintained today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Awesome regex is focused on providing people with a list of resources that they
        can choose from instead of proceeding with writing a traditional guide. This gives learners the
        flexibility of choice, something I peronally found to be absent in
        the regex world which happened to focus more on guides and tutorials to teach beginners.
