      <p>
        108 Ambulance is an app and website developed as part of the 108 Hacakathon
        held statewide in Tamil Nadu, India. The objective of the hackathon was
        to come up with something that emergency services could use in case of an emergency
        with focus being placed on location based services. 108 Ambulance does that
        and much more using the power of Google's APIs,
        offline triangulation using cell phone towers and an interactive chatbot
        that can converse in over 20 local languages.
      </p>
      <p>
         Location is identified using a three stage process:<br><br>
         1. If the user has internet access, it uses v1 of Google's GeoLocation APIs to get a rough 100m
         radius of where the user is located and returns that.<br><br>
         2. If the user still remains connected after the app sends a message, it updates the location
         using v2 of Google's GeoLocation APIs to provide a precise 10m radius of the user's location.<br><br>
         3. If the user is not connected to the internet, the app triangulates his position and sends
         the information as an SMS to 108's dedicated cell along with a link to the latitude
         and longitude on Google Maps for easy driver navigation.<br><br>
         If a user is incapable of accessing his phone at the time of the accident,
         an interactive chatbot immediately asks whether he's fit after 60s of delay. If no
         response is received within 30s of the alarm, the chatbot immediately calls 108's emergency cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        108 Ambulance also detects potential accidents using the gyroscope in a user's mobile phone.
        To avoid false positives, the chatbot
        in 108 Ambulance asks the user whether he's okay and if no repsonse is received within
        30s, the app proceeds to call 108's emergency cell, similar to the way in which it functions when
        a user is incapable of using his phone.
