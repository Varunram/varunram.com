        108 Ambulance is an app and website developed as a part of the 108 Hacakathon
        held statewide in Tamil Nadu, India. The main objective of the hackathon was
        to come up with something that the emergency services can use in case of one
        with a focus on location based services. 108 Ambulance does that and much more using the power of Google's APIs,
        offline triangulation of location using cell phone towers and an interactive chatbot
        that can converse in over 20 languages.
      </p>
      <p>
         The location is identified using a three stage process:<br><br>
         1. If the user has internet, use v1 of Google's GeoLocation APIs to get a rough 200m
         radius where the user is located and message that to 108's dedicated emergency cell<br><br>
         2. If the user still remains connected after we send the message, update the location
         using v2 of Google's GeoLocation APIs to provide a precise 10m radius of the user's location.<br><br>
         3. If the user is not connected to the internet, triangulate his position and send
         his location as an SMS to 108's dedicated cell along with a link to the latitude
         and longitude on Google Maps for the ambulance driver's navigation<br><br>
         If the user is incapable of unlocking the phone at the time of the accident,
         an interactive chatbot immediately asks him whether he's okay after a minute of delay. If no
         response is received within 30s, the chatbot immediately calls 108's emergency cell. This call
         is enough for 108 to respond to an emergency.
      </p>
      <p>
        108 Ambulance also detects accidents using the gyroscope in a user's mobile phone. It uses filtering to
        filter out false positives and detects legitimate collisions. To avoid false positives, the chatbot
        equipped in 108 Ambulance askss the user whethe he's okay. If no repsonse is received within
        30s, the app proceeds to call emergency services.
