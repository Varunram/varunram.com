        Lit is the Bitcoin Lightning Network implementation at the MIT Media Lab.
        The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin which
        enables low fees, instant payments without requiring third party custody of funds.
        Lit is written primarily in Go with a frontend UI written in Javascript and React.js
      </p>
      <p>
        Lit is different from the other projects I've worked on due to it
        being a research focused project taking pilot initiatives to implement something new
        at the protocol level. Proposing a change is rarely as simple as just having the code in place
        and has performance, optimization and usefulness dimensions to it as well. In most
        cases, there is no reference implementation to borrow code from since changes proposed are
        mostly new and hence the code review process involves extensive experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lit has lots of passionate people working on it and the opportunity to
        interact with them virtually and in person helps expand my knowledge. During my
        time at the Media Lab, I worked on improving spam detection, researched into novel
        Proof of Stake algorithms, bug fixes for lit along with interacting with people from other projects.
        This gave me the opportunity to see in person the amazing innovations being developed at the Media Lab, which
        could radically change the way we experience things.
