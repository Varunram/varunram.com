      <p>
        Lit is the Bitcoin Lightning Network implementation at the MIT Media Lab.
        The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin which
        enables low fees, instant payments without requiring third party custody
        Lit is written primarily in Go with a frontend UI written in Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lit is different from the other projects I've worked on due to it
        being a research project taking pilot initiatives to implement something new
        on the protocol level. Proposing a change is not as simple as just having code
        but has performance, optimization and usefulness dimensions as well. In most
        cases, there is no reference implementation to refer since changes are
        mostly new and hence the process involves extensive experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lit has many passionate people working on it and the opportunity to
        interact with them virtually and in person is a privilege. During my
        time at the Lab, I worked on improving spam detection, researched into novel
        Proof of Stake algorithms, bug fixes for lit among others. I also interacted
        with people from other projects and got to see so many new and pathberaking things
        being developed.
