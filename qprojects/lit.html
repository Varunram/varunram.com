      <p>
        Lit is the Bitcoin Lightning Network implementation at the MIT Media Lab.
        The Lightning Network is a layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, which
        enables low fee, instant payments without requiring third party custody
        Lit is written primarily in Go with a frontend UI written in Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lit is different from the other projects I've worked on before due to it
        being a research project taking pilot initiatives to implement something new
        on the protocol level. Proposing a change is not only code,
        but more on the performance and optimization side too. In most
        cases, there is no reference implementation to refer, since
        the changes are mostly new and hence this involves lots of experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lit has many passionate people working on it as well and the opportunity to
        interact with them virtually and in person is a bonus in itself. During my in person
        time at the Lab, I worked on improving spam detection, researched into novel
        Proof of Stake algorithms, bug fixed lit among others. I also happened to interact
        with other people from other projects, which was amazing since I got to see so many
        things that I never though I would.
