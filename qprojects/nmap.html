          <h1>Nmap</h1>
        </div>

      <p>The Nmap Project is an umbrella of projects which are collectively used by pentesters worldwide
        for network, packet and traffic analaysis. The most popular of these is the nmap scannner,
        initially authored by "Fyodor" in 1996.
       </p>
       <p>
         Nmap is written in C, with elements of C++ and also contains the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
         which is written in Lua. The goal of nmap written in C is for it to be easily used in a variety
         of environments along with the raw speed that C provides.
       </p>
       <p>
         My work with the Nmap Project over the course of 6 months was bug fixing the Nmap scanner, the Zenmap GUI,
         the Ncat tool and performing packet captures for the Npcap packet capture framework. I suggested 72 changes as Pull Requests to the
         namp project of which some were accepted into the main Nmap framework.
       </p>
       <p>
         My primarily goal at Nmap was to make it less buggy - some parts of the
         codebase were not touched for years and people had forgotten their true intent. Another
         change I made was converting code tyo C++11, which performed way faster due to the
         optimizations to the language over a decade (nmap uses C++ '03). Zenmap was in Python 2 and
         I opened a Pull Request in order to port it to python3. Other fixes to Zenmap include macOS
         compatibility checks and OS specific UI changes.
       </p>
       <p>
         I did some work on Ncat as well, whose purpose
         was similar to the standard but not maaintained native linux netcat framework. Apart from this,
         I worked on nmap's nascent Npcap framework and helped the lead maintainer fix bugs and get
         specific packet captures along wiht their analysis using Wireshark.
       </p>
       <p>
         It was interesting
         to test anonymous servers for a specific vulnerability and to report it to them
         if one was found. It also taught me lots of things about how the internet's base
         layer works and how the interenet is structured from a networks viewpoint.
         I also got nice trivia on important security statistics from some of the best
         in the field and had the opportunity to interact with some of them.
         Overall, Nmap was a great project and I enjoyed the time I worked on it.
