        The Nmap Project is an umbrella of projects collectively used by pentesters worldwide
        for network, packet and traffic analaysis. The most popular of these is the nmap scannner
        authored by Gordon "Fyodor" Lyon in 1996.

         Nmap is written in C, with elements of C++ and contains the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
         whose base is in Lua. The reason nmap is written in C is for it to be easily used in a variety
         of environments along with the performance boosts that C provides.

         My work with the Nmap Project over the course of 6 months was fixing bugs in the Nmap scanner, the Zenmap GUI,
         the Ncat tool and performing packet captures for the Npcap packet capture framework.
         My primarily goal at Nmap was to make it less buggy since some parts of the
         codebase were not touched for years and its true utility was forgotten. I also
         ported some parts from C++03 to C++11 which performs way faster due to
         optimizations to the language over the years. Other fixes include general macOS
         compatibility checks for all sub-projects, OS specific UI changes for Zenmap and general
         bug fixing in Ncat.

         Apart from contributing to Nmap, it was interesting
         to test anonymous servers for a specific vulnerability and to report if one was found and to take
         corrective action. It also taught me how the internet's base layer works, how its
         structured and provided the opportunity to interact with some of the best
         security researchers in the field. Overall, Nmap was a great project and I enjoyed the time I worked on it.
