        Dotty is a project at LAMP, EPFL whose purpose is to research
        upcoming trends and changes to the Scala Language (also
        developed at EPFL) and to get user feedback on upcoming changes to the Scala Language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dotty is written in Scala and is a scala compiler similar to sbt.
        It implements lots of proposed features that undergo a designated research phase
        before its incorporation
        into Scala itself. As a result, it has a reputation for being
        Scala beta, with lots of beta testers trying out dotty.

        I was helped by felixmulder at EPFL to improve the documentation of Dotty
        since it wasn't up to date and had loads of problems. Scala
        was my first functional language as well, so I took the opportunity to learn
        Scala and understand what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up improving the doc engine's performance and implemented a new UI for the docs,
        essentially revamping the existing framework.
        (The docs <a href="http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/">live here</a> in case you'd like to check them out)
        Apart from this, I worked on general bugfixing and reported a few issues
        I encountered while using dotty.
