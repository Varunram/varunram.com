        Dotty is a research project at LAMP, EPFL whose primary purpose is to research
        on upcoming trends and test changes to the Scala Language (also
        developed at EPFL) and get feedback from users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dotty is primarily written in Scala and is a compiler for scala, similar to sbt.
        It implements a lot of cahgnes that undergo a specific research phase before going
        live into the main Scala language. As a result, it has earned a reputation for being
        Scala beta, with testers coming to dotty  to try out some of the latest features
        in the lanugage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was supervised by felixmulder at EPFL to improve the documentation of Dotty,
        since it wasn't up to date with what was going on in Scala at the time. Scala
        was my first functional language as well, so I took the opportunity to learn
        basic Scala so that I could see what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up improving the doc engine's performance and  implemented a new UI
        for the documentation, essentially revamping the entire documentation itself.
        The docs are live over <a href="http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/">here</a> in case  you'd like to check them out.
        Aprt from this, I also worked on some general bugfixing and reported a few issues
        which I found while using dotty. I also wrote a guide to dotty that was later edited
        to be a starter's guide to dotty.
