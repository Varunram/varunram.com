      <p>
        Booststrap is the world's most popular CSS and JS framework.
        Bootstrap defines common css classes for most html elements so people don't have to style
        each element individually.
        Bootstrap also has a javascript framework that people can use for dropdowns, sliders and
        other commonly used snippets of code.
      </p>

        Due to the scale of bootstrap, changes are vetted through
        a thorough process from proposal to implementation. This usually takes a month or two
        and is a great experience in project management and community feedback incorporation.

        The changes I implemented at bootstrap were restricted to the CSS framework, where I
        introduced new classes, was responsible for renaming a popular class and did
        some general bug fixing.

        Bootstrap was a fun project and I happened to interact with lots of eminent design
        folks. I also invited one of the lead maintainers of bootstrap to help Musicoin,
        to which he agreed and suggested valuable changes to the Musicoin Desktop Wallet.
        This experience taught me about design decisions and greatly improved my design skills even
        though I had limited experience in design before. I still continue to be a
        contributor to bootstrap, reporting bugs and issues whenever I come across them.
