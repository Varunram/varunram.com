      <p>
        Booststrap is the worls' most popular CSS and JS framework used by most websites today.
        Bootstrap defeins common css classes for most html elements so that people don't have to style
        each element individually and does this in adherance with best design principles.
        Bootstrap also has a javascript framework that people can use for dropdowns, sliders, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the scale of bootstrap as one of the most popular projects, changes are vetted through
        a thorough process from proposal to implementation. This process usually takes a month
        and is a great experience in project management and feedback incorporation.

        The changes I implemented at bootstrap were restricted to the CSS framework, where I
        introduced new classes, was responsible for renaming a popular class (which was met with
        opposition, whom we had to negotiate with) and did some general bug fixing as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bootstrap was a fun project and I happened to interact with lots of interesting design
        folks there. I also invited on of the lead maintainers of bootstrap to help on a crpytocurrency
        that I founded called Musicoin, to which he agreed. These interesting experiences taught me
        a lot about design and improved my design skills a whole lot though I had limited to no experience
        in design before.
