      <p>
        Dangerous Dave is a remake of the classic retro game Dave in C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        It stands as one of my favourite projects since I got to learn lots of new things
        while still working on the stuff that I like. Retro games have alwyas
        been a passion of mine and it was ncie to finally see the dream realized in the form
        of a game that I made from scratch myself. It was also the first large scale project
        that I undertook.
