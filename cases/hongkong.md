# Hong Kong Anti Extradition Protests 2019

Context: More than 1 million people have gathered in different parts of Hong Kong to focus on one problem - the introduction of a bill that would make it possible for people hiding in Hong Kong to be extradited to China. The bill was introduced shortly after a man murdered his girlfriend in Taiwan and is a citizen of Hong Kong, so the Chinese government can't extradite him to China due to the absence of any treaty that allows extradition of such individuals.

The case presents itself as follows: You're Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong. You're faced with a bill which is supported by members of your party and by the ruling Communist Party of China. You're responsible for taking a call on whether the bill should pass and face all potential consequences for the decision. What would you do?
